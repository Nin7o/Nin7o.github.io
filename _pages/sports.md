Capture The Flag

I have been learning a lot through hobbies, especially CTF. I have completed the OverTheWire Bandit CTF, which helped me a lot in the process of learning and mastering the linux environment. I plan on doing multiple CTF throughout the years, because they each have specificities that makes them unique and educational.
