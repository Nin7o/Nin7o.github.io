<ins>Internship Report</ins>

At the end of my first year at ENSEEIHT, I had the opportunity to do a 3 weeks language travel and 4 weeks internship in Japan. During the first three weeks, I was in Yokohama, near Tokyo where me and my classmates had Japanese lessons in the morning and cultural activities in the afternoon. During the last four weeks, I was in Nasushiobara, in the Tochigi prefecture, where I worked in a company called [Caro Foresta](https://caro-foresta.com/index.php). 

This company is an hotel and restaurant, which aims to host guests and their pets in a forest environment. I was there with a classmate, and we working in the hotel maintenance team. We had to do various tasks, such as cleaning the rooms, helping the guests, and doing some gardening. We also had the opportunity to work in the kitchen, and to help the chef prepare the meals.

During our internship, we had either a morning or an afternoon shift, so we worked either from 8am to 2pm, or from 2pm to 8pm. We had a day off every week, that we were able to use to visit the region. During our first week there, we were coached by an employee with some English skills, but after that, we were on our own. We had to communicate with the other employees in japanese. It was a great opportunity to improve our japanese skills, and to learn more about the japanese culture.
Our responsabilities were quite important, as we were part of the team cleaning the guests rooms, and we had to make sure that everything was perfect for them. When working with the chef, we had different tasks, such as preparing the ingredients, cleaning the dishes or serving the meals to the guests. 

We were living in the hotel, so we were living with the other employees. It was a great opportunity to learn more about the japanese culture, and to improve our japanese skills. We were able to talk with them during the meals, and we were also able to go out with them during our days off. This was an amazing experience, and I am really glad I had the opportunity to do it : The main manager of the hotel was really nice, and he helped us a lot during our stay, as well as recommending us places to visit during our days off, restaurants to try, and so on.

I think this experience was really important for me, as it helped me improve my japanese skills, but also others : I had to learn how to communicate with people who do not speak english, and I had to learn how to work in a team, with people who do not speak the same language as me in a professional environment. This does not only mean learning japanese, but also learning how to communicate efficciently, simply and clearly without misunderstanding. 

This experience of the japanese culture was also really important for me, as I was able to learn more about the japanese way of life, and to learn more about the japanese culture. I find this experience of a professional environment in a foreign country really important, as it helps me learn more about the world, and about the people living in it. I think this is a really important experience, and I am really glad I had the opportunity to do it.

If anyone is interested in doing a similar experience, I would recommend them to do it, as it is a really great opportunity to learn more about the world, and to learn more about yourself. 

I would like to thank the [Caro Foresta](https://caro-foresta.com/index.php) team for welcoming us, and for helping us during our stay. I would also like to thank Miss Yoshiko, responsible for the language travel, for putting us in contact with the hotel, and for helping us during our stay. If I was able to enjoy this trip as much as I did, it is thanks to them.
