Tutoring
======

![Bellevue](/files/bellevue.jpeg)

Since the beginning of the school year 2022, I and two other friends from the school have volunteered to become tutors for two first-year CPGE students at Bellevue high school, where we ourselves did our CPGE.
Our responsibility towards these students is obviously to help them with their lessons and exercises, to be at their disposal for questions to which they do not have the answer. Moreover, we accompany them and advise them in their study project thanks to our experience that we can transmit to them today.
This project also teaches me a lot in terms of responsibility and commitment, which is why I am now grateful for being their tutor.
  
First update :   
Now than half of the school year is almost over, me and the other tutors have been able to help them many times, by going to the library to study with them, respond to their questions or reread their work.  
We have also been in touch with their teachers, to make sure that they arr improving and this tutoring works ! Both of them are successful and their studies are going in the right direction.
