TIPE
======

My first engineering project is the one i have made during CPGE in a group of 3. Our goal was to conceive, design and produce a myoelectric hand prosthesis.

While i worked on the whole project, the one I worked on the most was the design of the prosthesis and its control.

This project allowed to learn about teamwork, communication, and speech since i've presented this project in front of a jury.

The final prosthesis was fully operational, allows different movements and to grip heavy loads, that is to say to allow a person to regain autonomy thanks to an inexpensive and autonomous system
