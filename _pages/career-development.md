Thanks to the MyJobGlasses Website, I have been able to reach out to professionals working in a field in which I could see myself working in the future. That's how I got in touch with Guillaume Laurent, an independent ios developer.

Thanks to him, I have learned a lot about the direction I want my carrer to go in : 

A more entreprenorial approach, by working in a small team, or to do prestations for a bigger compagny : Here the workload is bigger, but the job is often more interesting.

An employee or engineer approach, where thez workload is often smaller but where you don't work on an entire project but just a part of it, and rarely have to see the globality of your work.

for now, i don't know in which direction i want my carrer to go, but I am interested by working on the more global side of a project, but this might evolve.
