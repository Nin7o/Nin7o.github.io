Subject: Application for Amazon Technology Internship in Dublin

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am very interested by the Technology Internship opportunity at Amazon in Dublin. My passion for innovative and cutting edge technologies being able to contribute to challenges is very exciting, and I look forward the prospect 
of joining a dynamic environment at Amazon.

The importance around the customer satisfaction is what give me a positive view of the compagny, and the idea of being able to work with experience professionals is directly compatible with my careers aspirattions. I am particularly excited by the perspective to work on large scale distributed systems.

Having a backround in distributed data computing in java, I am confident in my ability to fulfill Amazon's mission, using agile methods that I've learned during my studies to produce high-quality software.

The chance of having a mentor is also one of the resaons why I find this opportunity amazing : the experience provided by a mentor, with a long-term experience in the company will as sure allow me to greatly develop my skills.

I am available for a 3 month internship, and I am also able to move to work on site in the city of Dublin. Having more than a remote experience is really important for me, and I am eager to bring my skills and dynamism to Amazon

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss more about how my skills and experience aligne with the interniship requirements.

Sincerely,

GAUTHIER Nino

Thanks to the MyJobGlasses Website, I have been able to reach out to professionals working in a field in which I could see myself working in the future. That's how I got in touch with Guillaume Laurent, an independent ios developer.

Thanks to him, I have learned a lot about the direction I want my carrer to go in : 

A more entreprenorial approach, by working in a small team, or to do prestations for a bigger compagny : Here the workload is bigger, but the job is often more interesting.

An employee or engineer approach, where the workload is often smaller but where you don't work on an entire project but just a part of it, and rarely have to see the globality of your work.

for now, i don't know in which direction i want my carrer to go, but I am interested by working on the more global side of a project, but this might evolve.
