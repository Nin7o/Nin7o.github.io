First, to learn more about me, my skills and the studies I have achieved so far, I suggest you take a look at my LinkedIn profile ! 
It contains all those informations, and interactions I have had with the professional world. I also recommend you watch my presentation video on the homepage on this website,
which helps understand my goals and motivations !

The next step in my professional journey is my CV, and the people who I have talked to to precise the career I want to achieve in the future. 
I have had the chance to talk to an independant IOS developer, which gave me a more precise idea of what I aim to regarding my professional career. 

I also have here an example of a cover letter, made for an internship application to Amazon, Dublin.

All of the informations regarding this are available on my ePortfolio, juste [here](https://nin7o.github.io/career-development).

Last year, I have had the chance to travel to Japan for my first year internship. That travel was a amazing opportunity where I have been 
able to work in a totally new environment, which helped me learn a lot, especially regarding human interactions, in a country where lots of people
do not speak english. It also helped me improve my Japanese level.

This trip enters my International Mobility, and you can find all the details of my intership through an internship report on [this page](https://nin7o.github.io/international-mobility).

Here is my PPP presentation !
