First, to learn more about me, my skills and the studies I have achieved so far, I suggest you take a look at my LinkedIn profile ! 
It contains all those informations, and interactions I have had with the professional world.

The next step in my professional journey is my CV, and the people who I have talked to to precise the career I want to achieve in the future. 
I have had the chance to talk to an independant IOS developer, which gave me a more precise idea of what I aim to regarding my professional career. 

All of the informations regarding this are available on my ePortfolio, juste [here](https://nin7o.github.io/career-development)
