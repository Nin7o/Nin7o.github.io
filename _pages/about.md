Hello ! 

My name is Nino Gauthier and I am a second year computer science student at [ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France](https://www.enseeiht.fr/en/index.html), specialized in architecture systems and networks.
I am currently looking for a **10-12 weeks internship abroad** in my field, to aquire more experience and learn to be more efficient in terms of communication and teamworking in english. I want to pursue my studies and hopefully specialize in cybersecurity in my third year.

Welcome to my website, I hope you will learn more about me after reading those pages !
